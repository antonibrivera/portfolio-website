Link to live site: https://joseph-portfolio.vercel.app/

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my portfolio website! Feel free to poke around at the code to see how everyhting was made. And don't be afraid to visit the website with the link above. 

This is my portfolio website meant to house all of my software development work as I continue to grow in the industry. It was made using mobile-first principles, ensuring that anyone can access the website no matter what device they're on. My portfolio was build using front-end technologies only with no need for a Node.js server as the site itself is static.
