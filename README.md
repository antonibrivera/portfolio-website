## Summary

This is my portfolio website meant to house all of my software development work as I continue to grow in the industry. It was made using mobile-first principles, ensuring that anyone can access the website no matter what device they're on. My portfolio was build using front-end technologies only with no need for a Node.js server as the site itself is static.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5/JSX
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- React.js
